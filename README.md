# Tutorial_lab_computer

In Lab computer, there are one root user(zou_lab) and four sub users (private).

Pycharm and Teamviewer are ready for all users. Please check whether they work. 

In root user account, path /home/apps are public files, sub users could enter cd /home/zou_lab/apps in terminal to visit the files. 

So, recommended installation path is under the /home/apps. If other installation path, record the path and use chown terminal command to set the path file permission.

Sub users open the softwaves via desktop shortcut. 
DO NOT Delete the shortcut.

Without shortcut, could open the softwaves(eg. pycharm) by entering the terminal command 

cd /home/zou_lab/apps/pycharm/bin # installation path

sh pycharm.sh
